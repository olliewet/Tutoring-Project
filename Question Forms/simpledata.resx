    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>This is a valid program. If you gave it to a C# compiler it would compile, and you could run it. The actual work is done by the two lines that I have highlighted. Broadly speaking the stuff before these two lines is concerned with setting things up and getting the values in to be processed. The stuff after the two lines is concerned with displaying the answer to the user. We can now go through each line in turn and try to see how it fits into our program. You will be asked questions regarding the piece of code provided.

    <value>The C# language is object oriented. Objects are an organisational mechanism which let you break your program down into sensible chunks, each of which is in charge of part of the overall system. Object Oriented Design makes large projects much easier to design, test and extend. It also lets you create programs which can have a high degree of reliability and stability. I am very keen on object-oriented programming, but I am not going to tell you much about it just yet. This is not because I don't know much about it (honest) but because I believe that there are some very fundamental programming issues which need to be addressed before we make use of objects in our programs. The use of objects is as much about design as programming, and we have to know how to program before we can design larger systems.</value>

  <data name="richTextBox3.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>C# is a compiled programming language. The computer cannot understand the language directly, so a program called a compiler converts the C# text into the low level instructions which are much simpler. These low level instructions are in turn converted into the actual commands to drive the hardware which runs your program. 
A compiler is a very large program which knows how to decide if your program is legal. The first thing it does is check for errors in the way that you have used the language itself. Only if no errors are found by the compiler will it produce any output. The compiler will also flag up warnings which occur when it notices that you have done something which is not technically illegal, but may indicate that you have made a mistake somewhere. An example of a warning situation is where you create something but don't use it for anything. The compiler would tell you about this, in case you had forgotten to add a bit of your program.
Microsoft has made a tool called Visual Studio, which is a great place to write programs. It comprises the compiler, along with an integrated editor, and debugger. It is provided in a number of versions with different feature sets. There is a free version, called Visual Studio Express edition, which is a great place to get started. Another free resource is the Microsoft .NET Framework. This provides a bunch of command line tools, i.e. things that you type to the command prompt, which can be used to compile and run C# programs.
